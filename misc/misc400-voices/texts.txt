I can't remember the last time
That I said goodbye, or that I even tried
I'm becoming afraid, it's already to late
I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive
I hope this isn't my last night
As I lose my mind, and try to save my life
I'm becoming afraid, it's already too late
I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive
Take my hand
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me fade away
Don't let me die today
Take my hand
I'll pray for you today
I beg to see another day
Don't let me die today
I hope this isn't my last night
As I lose my mind, and try to save my life
I'm becoming afraid, it's already too late
I'm on my knees, please help me stay alive
I could say you're the only one,
Then I'd be lying,
I could say that we're dead and done,
But I know that you'd only be crying,
There's only so much I can do,
To try and fix you,
Go! It's time we've realized fighting my eyes
With the sun, this insomnia is eating at my soul
and I got nothing left to show
This could honestly be a problem
I've had no sleep and it's getting hard trying to think
I haven't slept a night and I'm paying through the fucking nose
Try and wake me up, let me know which way the wind blows
Fuck what you said, fuck what you did, listen
All alone trying to read all the faces unspoken
In other words, must be broken
Hypnotize me, make me believe that this was all just a dream
I wish I was, waste away, wasting way
Spending all my time running these empty fucking streets
Watch me waste away, it's quite simply said
What's the point of a day. We are the walking dead!
Watch me waste away, all alone
trying to read all the faces unspoken
in other words I must be broken
Hypnotize me, make me believe that I must be dreaming
I wish I was, fucking oath mate, let me sleep!
Say what you mean the future isn`t what it used to be
You tore out my heart but i have found it again
Say what you mean the future isn`t what we used to be
You tore out my heart
But heart i found you bitch
Move bitch get out the way
Get out of the way bitch
My hands are full
My mind is straight
I hate to break this to you
You we`re never anything to me
The sharing of saliva
I`ll spit it back in your face
Am i losing my mind (wasting time)
Paptured in these chapters
How do you turn the page?
When you`re stuck in an empty place
So what when i met you
So wat if i gave it to you
The wrong impression
